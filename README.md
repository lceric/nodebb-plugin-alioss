# NodeBB Aliyun OSS Plugin
基于 

This plugin is a fork of [nodebb-plugin-s3-uploads](https://github.com/LouiseMcMahon/nodebb-plugin-s3-uploads).

This plugin is base of [nodebb-plugin-ali-oss](https://github.com/ziofat/nodebb-plugin-ali-oss).

`npm install nodebb-plugin-alioss`

| Plugin Version | Dependency     | Version Requirement     |
| ---------------| -------------- |:-----------------------:|
| 0.1.1          | NodeBB         | >= 1.0.0 |

A plugin for NodeBB to take file uploads and store them on S3, uses the `filter:uploadImage` hook in NodeBB. 

## Aliyun OSS Configuration

You can configure this plugin via a combination of the below, for instance, you can use **environment variables**. You can also configure via the NodeBB Admin panel, which will result in the Bucket and Credentials being stored in the NodeBB Database.

If you decide to use the Database storage for Credentials, then they will take precedence over both Environment Variables and Instance Meta-data, the full load order is:

1. Database
2. Environment Variables

For instance, for [talk.kano.me](http://talk.kano.me), we store the Bucket name in an Environment Variable, and the Credentials are discovered automatically with the Security Token Service.

### Environment Variables

```
export OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="myaliyunkey"
export OSS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="myaliyunsecret"
export OSS_DEFAULT_REGION="oss-cn-hangzhou"
export OSS_UPLOADS_BUCKET="mybucket"
export OSS_UPLOADS_HOST="host"
export OSS_UPLOADS_PATH="path"
```

**NOTE:** Asset host is optional - If you do not specify an asset host, then the default asset host is `<bucket>.<endpoint>.aliyuncs.com`.
**NOTE:** Asset path is optional - If you do not specify an asset path, then the default asset path is `/`.

### Database Backed Variables

From the NodeBB Admin panel, you can configure the following settings to be stored in the Database:

* `bucket` — The S3 bucket to upload into
* `host` - The base URL for the asset.  **Typcially http://\<bucket\>.\<endpoint\>.aliyuncs.com**
* `Region` - The endpoint of the OSS. **like oss-cn-hangzhou**
* `path` - The asset path (optional)
* `accessKeyId` — The OSS Access Key Id
* `secretAccessKey` — The OSS Secret Access Key

**NOTE: Storing your OSS Credentials in the database is bad practice, and you really shouldn't do it.**
